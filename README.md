# SolusiKos Prototype

## 🚧 Project Status: Interactive SaaS Prototype (Frontend-Only) 🚧

**SolusiKos** is a high-fidelity web prototype of a boarding house (kos) marketplace platform inspired by Mamikos.

This prototype is built specifically for **P2MW competition purposes** and demonstrates a production-grade SaaS experience using fully simulated (dummy) data.
